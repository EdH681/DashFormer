A platformer I created to practice hitboxes, physics simulations and sprites in pygame
When the mouse is clicked the game finds the x and y unit vector toward the mouse then multiplies it by a constant force
The y component has gravity which pulls the player down until a constant terminal velocity
The x component has friction which increases when the player is on a platform and the ground
Some platforms and walls have spikes which prevent the player from touching them
All sprites and objects ghave a hitbox which make them solid
